    <string name="bjjDescription">Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is known among
        other martial arts as "The Gentle Art" because it is a grappling
        sport with no striking. Since there is no striking, sparing is
        done at 100% intensity and mimics live competition very well.
        essentially a match is over when either someone submits, by
        tapping out, or the timer runs out and scores are tallied.

    <string name="travelDescription">My family and I do a lot of domestic
        travel. We have toured the east coast by car, we frequent New Orleans,
        and try to visit a different American major city every year. We have a
        lot of fun with this hobby. I often combine this hobby with my sports hobby.
